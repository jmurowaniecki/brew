Mighty Braggot
=============

Pretty much Schramm's braggot recipe from The Compleat Meadmaker.

Brew Date: 2013-07-20

Target Volume:  25L  
Target OG:      1.125  
Target FG:      1.035  
Target abv:     12%  

Ingredients
-----------
* 5kg Pale Ale Malt
* 1.2kg Vienna Malt
* 0.6kg Carapils Malt
* 190g Cascade Hops
* 5.4kg Honey (Get a honey with a strong aroma!)
* 1 tbsp yeast nutrient
* 1-2 vial(s) White Labs Edinburgh Ale Yeast (WLP-028)

Steps
-----
1. Grind the malt.
2. Heat 15L of water to 82°C.
3. Lower heat and add and the malt.
4. Keep around 63°C for 60 minutes.
5. Mashout (Heat to 72°C).
6. Filter the wort from the grains.
7. Boil the wort for 60 minutes.
8. Add 120g Cascade hops at the start and keep in for the full 60 minutes.
9. After 30 minutes add an additional 35g of Cascade hops.
10. After 55 minutes add 1 tbsp of Yeast Nutrient (I used wyeast).
11. Finish off with a final 35g of Cascade hops for the last 2 minutes.
12. After 60 minutes, cut the heat, remove the hops and cool the wort.
13. Add the honey and top off with cold water to reach ~25l.
14. When the wort/must has reached room temperature, pitch your Yeast (I'm thinking 1.5 vials will be necessary).
15. Take a sample for original gravity reading if you haven't already done so (Mine was 1.125 at 32°C).
16. Transfer the wort/must to your fermentation container if you haven't already.
17. Wait for 4? weeks for the fermentation to complete
18. Take a gravity reading, we're aiming for ~1.035 which will result in a splendid ~12% abv!
19. Either bottle now, or rack and let it clarify and bottle later.
20. Enjoy a nice cold braggot.

Additional Notes
----------------
This beer stinks like hell when fermenting apparently? (Note: Settles after ~12 Weeks)
The honey really takes over the final taste, future versions could up the ratio of malt to honey and add more hops.
This recipe might really benefit from dry-hopping, the aroma is very simple and malty (reminiscent of toast bread?)
